# Bookmark Landing Page

This is a Bookmark Manager landing page built with HTML, JS, and SCSS. The page only has a few interactive elements so I decided it made sense to avoid the baggage of bundlers/frameworks.

## Features

- Responsive design
- Feature Switcher
- Mobile and desktop navigation implemented
- Email submit form with validation
- FAQ Accordion
